# Exploring Cost Management and Billing on Azure and GCP
## Azure Cost Management/Billing Overview
In this excercise, I explored the cost management boards on both Azure and GCP. I also navigated through the billing section to set budgets, alerts, and monitor costs of subscriptions. 
On Azure, I watched a tutorial to review the dashboards and the related tools and reports of manageing costs. Under monitor costs, Azure pr ovides graphs of service name, subsciption and the location of your organization. I also created a monthly budget of 8 dollars and created a notification alert when the spending reached 80 percent of that spending. Finally, the advisor tab gives advice on future costs as well as cost saving options.
## GCP Cost Managment/Billing Overview
On GCP, I did the same thing of creating a monlthy budget of 8 dollars and created a notification when the spending reached the budget. I found GCP easier to navigate as compared to Azure however, they showcase the same things. I found the alerts most interesting where you can input when these cloud services should notify you.
